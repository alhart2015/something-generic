IDEAS
Game idea:
you are trying to find a path from point a to point b.
you get there by going across "bridges".
connecting the bridges are "islands".
each "bridge" has a color.
each "bridge" is either on or off.
each "island" either has a "button" on it or does not.
each "button" has a color.
when you step on a "button", you turn on the "bridges" that have that color.
