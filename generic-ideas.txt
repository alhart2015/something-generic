IDEAS
Game idea:
you are trying to find a path from point a to point b.
you get there by going across "bridges".
connecting the bridges are "islands".
each "bridge" has a color.
each "bridge" is either on or off.
each "island" either has a "button" on it or does not.
each "button" has a color.
when you step on a "button", you turn on the "bridges" that have that color.

COMMENTS
 - My only concern here is that this opens the door for unsolvable levels.  
   Because this isn't a deterministic game (like 2048 or even sudoku) we
   could run into problems like levels that are either too easy or impossible.
   One possible way around this could be to do it the way (I assume) flow does
   it, which is make complete levels and backtrack to the starting configuration,
   but I'm not sure how hard that would be.  Thoughts?
